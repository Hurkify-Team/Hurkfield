This is a practical, non-technical runbook for supervisors.

## Step 1: Create the project

- Set status to Active

## Step 2: Create the template (form)
- Go to Templates -> Create
- Add your questions and mark required fields
- Enable consent or attestation if needed
- Save and open the Share panel

## Step 3: Define coverage (optional)
- Go to Coverage under the project
- Create a coverage set
- Add location nodes (Country -> State -> LGA -> Ward)

## Step 4: Add enumerators
- Go to Enumerators
- Add name and optional code
- Optional: assign to coverage and template

## Step 5: Share links
- Use the Share panel for each template
- If using assignments, share the assignment-specific link
- Use the QR code for fast field distribution

## Step 6: Collect and monitor
