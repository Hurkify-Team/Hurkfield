# Decision-Maker Guide

This guide is for program leads, directors, and funders who review results.

## What QA alerts mean
- Missing required fields: data needs a follow-up
- Duplicate flags: same household/facility captured twice
- GPS missing: location not captured for that submission

## How to trust the data
- Review QA Alerts before approving exports
- Spot-check 5–10 submissions for completeness
- Compare enumerator counts with expected coverage targets

## How to interpret exports
- CSV is best for Excel, SPSS, Stata
- JSON is best for dashboards or custom analysis
- Use metadata export to verify templates and enumerators

## Decision checklist
- QA flags resolved
- Coverage targets met
- Export shared with timestamped filename
